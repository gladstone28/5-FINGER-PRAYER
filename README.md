#### FROM THE MINISTER'S DESK (SUNDAY 11 FEBRUARY 2024)

The Five Finger Prayer is a simple, yet effective, way to remember different groups of people to pray for. It uses the fingers on one hand as a mnemonic for various prayer focuses. Here's a brief explanation of each finger:

1. **Thumb (Those Closest to You):** Your thumb is the closest finger to you, so it reminds you to pray for those closest to your heart, such as your family and friends. Praying for their needs, joys, sorrows, and protection.

2. **Index Finger (Those Who Teach, Instruct, and Heal):** This finger is used for pointing and reminds us to pray for those who teach, instruct, and heal, including teachers, doctors, and pastors. These are people who need wisdom and support to guide others in the right direction.

3. **Middle Finger (Those in Authority):** The tallest finger reminds us to pray for leaders and those in authority over us—government leaders, bosses, and anyone with authority. They need God’s guidance to make decisions that are in the best interests of everyone.

4. **Ring Finger (Those Who Are Weak):** This is your weakest finger, as any piano teacher will testify. It reminds us to pray for those who are weak, in trouble, or in pain. This can include those suffering from illness, poverty, or oppression, asking for their strength and support.

5. **Little Finger (Your Own Needs):** Finally, your little finger reminds you to pray for your own needs. By placing our own needs last, it reflects a posture of humility, acknowledging the importance of others' needs alongside our own.

This method of prayer is designed to be easy to remember and to help ensure that we cover a wide range of prayer concerns in our daily lives. It's a helpful tool for those who want to enrich their prayer life and ensure they are considering a broad spectrum of needs in their prayers.
